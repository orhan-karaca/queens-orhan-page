This repository contains a simple personal webpage built with HTML and CSS and hosted using GitHub Pages.

The site introduces who I am, the courses I am taking, projects I am working on, and how to contact me.

Files:

- `index.html`  
  Contains the structure and content of the webpage using semantic HTML elements.

- `style.css`  
  Handles all styling, layout, colors, and responsive design.

- `me.jpg`  
  Portrait photo displayed in the About Me section.

Design Choices:

- A dark background with a light card layout was used to keep content readable and visually focused.
- A purple accent color highlights important text and section dividers.
- Flexbox is used in the About Me section to place text and image side-by-side on desktop and stacked on mobile.
- All styling is kept in CSS to make future updates easy.

Mobile Use:

The layout adapts to smaller screens
- The About Me section stacks vertically on mobile.
- Text and lists remain readable without being squished.

Deployment

The site is hosted with GitHub Pages and built from the `main` branch.
